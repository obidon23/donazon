HOW TO USE DONAZON's CUSTOMER APP

Launch donazonCustomer.js and you'll get a list of the items we have for sale. Not everything is in stock, however. To order, simply enter the product number and the quantity you require. We'll check our shelves and process your order if we have enough items available. 

Get your credit card ready, though, because once you start making orders, you won't be able to stop!

HOW IT WORKS

1. Upon launching the app a menu of products and pricing is pulled from the database of inventory items.

2. The database is currently showing 20 games of Uno in stock and 19 games of Set.

3. When the customer selects a product and quantity, we check the inventory. Unfortunately, we don't have 100 copies of Set available.

4. We do, however, have enough copies of Uno to fill an order of 2. We then calculate the total cost of the products and remove them from the inventory.

5. The refreshed database shows a drop in quantity from 20 to 18.
